Prototype02 is the final prototype.\
Prototype01 was nice for a small data set, but for the 500 records I had to display, prototype01 would be too difficult to scroll and keep an eye on the active record.

## To View
Download the zipped code folder from the green button on Github. Open one of the .html files.
